    <h3>Some interesting facts about VR:</h3>
    <p>
    The Sensorama: Precursor to Modern VR: In the 1960s, Morton Heilig developed a machine called the "Sensorama" which could display stereoscopic 3D images, play sound, and even emit smells. Users would sit in front of the machine with their head inside a hood, and they could experience a simulated motorcycle ride through a city. This early invention laid the groundwork for the immersive experiences that VR would later offer.

    VR in Medicine and Therapy: Virtual reality has found applications beyond entertainment. It's being used in medical training, therapy, and rehabilitation. Surgeons can practice procedures in a virtual environment before performing them on real patients. VR has also been used to help people overcome phobias and anxieties through exposure therapy in a controlled, virtual setting.
    <p>
    VR Art and Creativity: VR is not only about gaming and simulations. It has become a platform for artists to create immersive digital artworks. Artists can "paint" in 3D space, sculpt virtual clay, and even collaborate on virtual installations across the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
    VR and Remote Collaboration: VR technology is being harnessed for remote collaboration. Teams spread across different locations can meet up in a shared virtual space, making it feel like they're in the same room. This has the potential to transform the way people work together, especially in a world where remote work is becoming more common.
